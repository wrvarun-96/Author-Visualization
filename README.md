# Author-Visulization

Introduction

A dataset of the articles published with the theme of data visualization is provided in this example. Using the network visualization we can explore the existence of different clusters and relationships. The features of the articles include the unique ID of the article, List of Authors, ID of the authors, title, affiliations, etc.

Assignment Objectives

The process of making a network visualization depends heavily on the formatting of the data and applying the layout of the visualization and the main idiom for observing related data and gaining insight from these relationships.
This visualization project has the following objectives:
Improve skills in processing Network Data, using Python libraries such as NetworkX and Pandas.
Learn how to format the exported data for use with D3JS or other JS-based libraries.
Learn how to use forceSimulation layout generator in D3JS
Learn how to format, style, and edit network visualizations in line with Ben Shneiderman's Mantra
